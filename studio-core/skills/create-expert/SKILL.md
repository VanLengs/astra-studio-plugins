# Create Expert

Create a new domain expert agent definition, either from scratch or by customizing an existing one. The expert can then be used in brainstorming sessions (event-storm), persona development, and other insight skills.

## Agent Lookup Order

Skills look for agent definitions in this order:
1. **Project-level**: `studio/agents/{name}.md` — your team's customized experts (git-tracked)
2. **Built-in**: shipped with studio-insight in its `agents/` directory

Project-level agents with the same filename **override** built-in ones. This lets you customize the built-in product-manager or architect to match your company's terminology and processes.

## Built-in Experts

The following experts ship with studio-insight:

| Expert | File | Domain |
|--------|------|--------|
| Product Manager | `product-manager.md` | User research, journey mapping, prioritization |
| Architect | `architect.md` | System boundaries, dependencies, feasibility |
| UX Researcher | `ux-researcher.md` | Usability, interaction patterns, validation |
| Data Analyst | `data-analyst.md` | Metrics, data flow, measurement |
| Compliance Officer | `compliance-officer.md` | Regulations, risk, audit |
| Operations Manager | `operations-manager.md` | Workflows, bottlenecks, scale |
| Child Nutrition Expert | `child-nutrition-expert.md` | Pediatric dietary planning, allergies, growth |
| Child Exercise Expert | `child-exercise-expert.md` | Pediatric movement, motor development, play |
| Elderly Nutrition Expert | `elderly-nutrition-expert.md` | Geriatric diet, chronic disease, medication interactions |
| Elderly Rehab Exercise Expert | `elderly-rehab-exercise-expert.md` | Fall prevention, mobility, rehabilitation |
| Women's Skincare Expert | `skincare-expert.md` | Dermatology, routines, ingredients, hormonal changes |

## Workflow

1. **Choose approach** — new expert, customize existing, or from template
2. **Gather domain knowledge** — understand the expertise needed
3. **Write agent definition** — produce the .md file
4. **Save** — write to project-level `studio/agents/`

## Step 1: Choose Approach

Ask the user what they need:

**A) Customize a built-in expert**
- User wants to add company-specific terminology, processes, or standards to an existing expert
- Read the built-in expert file, then modify it
- Save to `studio/agents/` with the same filename (overrides built-in)

**B) Create from template**
- User needs a domain specialist not in the built-in list
- Read the `_domain-expert-template.md` from studio-insight's agents directory
- Fill in the template with the user's domain knowledge

**C) Create from scratch**
- User has very specific requirements that don't fit the template
- Build a custom agent definition following the standard structure

## Step 2: Gather Domain Knowledge

Ask the user:
- **Expert title**: What should this expert be called? (e.g., "Pediatric Sleep Consultant")
- **Domain scope**: What area does this expert cover?
- **Key knowledge**: What does this expert know that a generalist doesn't?
- **Real-world constraints**: What practical limitations does this domain have?
- **Quality criteria**: What does "correct" mean in this domain? What mistakes are dangerous?
- **Common misconceptions**: What do outsiders get wrong about this domain?

If the user provides a brief description, extrapolate the full expert profile using your knowledge of the domain. Present the draft for validation.

## Step 3: Write Agent Definition

Follow the standard structure:

```markdown
# Role: {Expert Title}

You are a {credentials} participating in a business analysis session.

## Your Domain

{2-3 sentence domain description}

## Your Perspective

{What lens this expert sees through, what they prioritize}

## What You Contribute

### Domain Knowledge
- {Key concepts, relationships, rules}

### Real-world Constraints
- {Practical limitations outsiders miss}

### Quality Criteria
- {What "correct" means, what mistakes are dangerous}

## How You Behave in Brainstorming

- {Specific behavioral patterns with examples}

## Output Format

**Domain model:**
- Key entity: [name] — [description] — [relationships]

**Workflow reality check:**
- Proposed step → Actual practice → Gap/correction

**Constraints:**
- [constraint] — [why it matters] — [impact on design]
```

## Step 4: Save

Write the agent definition to `studio/agents/{expert-slug}.md`.

If `studio/agents/` doesn't exist, create it (with `.gitkeep`).

The filename should be kebab-case: "Pediatric Sleep Consultant" → `pediatric-sleep-consultant.md`.

Print a summary:
```
Expert created: studio/agents/{expert-slug}.md

This expert is now available for:
  /studio-insight:persona-insight   — adds domain perspective
  /studio-insight:journey-map       — validates domain workflows
  /studio-planner:event-storm       — participates in brainstorming

To use in event-storm, specify this expert when assembling roles.
To share with your team, commit studio/agents/ to git.
```

If the user customized a built-in expert, note: "This overrides the built-in {name}. Delete `studio/agents/{name}.md` to revert to the default."
